### Geography
I live in the USA on planet Earth in the Milky Way galaxy.

### Reading
Three of my favorite books are:
- *Good Omens* by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett
- *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline
- *Last of Her Name* by Jessica Khoury

And as **imagination** bodies forth,
The forms of things *unknown*, the poet's pen,
Turns them to sapes and gives to airy nothing,
A local *habitation* and a **name**.

My favorite foods are:

1. Enchiladas
2. Ice Cream
3. Noodles
